REST PRINCIPLES

Going to a site does a GET request

A rest api uses the http verbs
A rest api is a way of thinking about how a web server responds to your requests

A web server responds with resources/data

RESOURCES/THING IN A WEB server


#Item RESOURCE

GET /item/chair
POST /item/chair with extra data
PUT /item/chair with extra data
DELETE /item/chair

#ItemList RESOURCE
GET /items 

A rest api is stateless

Another key feature if a REST is that a request does not depend on another request
